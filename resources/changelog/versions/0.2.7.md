bookmark view is the core functionality of plugin Bookmark X.

Now, in bookmark 0.2.x, you can manage bookmarks in a workspace(contains projects)

When a single project is opened, it's behaviour doesn't change.

When a workspace(contains projects) is opened, you need to know that, bookmark data is binded with the workspace but not with every single project.

That means, next time, you open one project of the previous workspace, the bookmarks in that project can't be loaded.

When create a bookmark, it will determine which project the current bookmark belongs to and add the bookmark to the corresponding project.
